The blog is coming along. I've been doing some more work on my utility type
library for TypeScript. I've been doing a lot of clean up.

I've put together a playlist of witchhouse, \*-core, and \*-wave stuff. Normally
I don't like to listen to music with vocals when coding but it's been keeping
me vibing whe I'm in my text editor.

I'm 41... Am I allowed to say "vibing"? Oh well, I said it. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

It's funny since Covid I don't think I've really cared about a lot of things I
used to care about. Appearances are one of those things. I don't try to be
cringe but if I am I couldn't care less. Also being a parent has helped me to
get over myself in a lot of ways.

It's been a rough journey but I think about the days when I used to have
crippling social anxiety and I don't even know that person anymore. I can't
imagine how I got so wrapped around myself and didn't see there was anyting
wrong.

Anyway I guess that's just part of being kind to yourself... Not judging
yourself too harshly and not paying attention to the things that really don't
matter.
