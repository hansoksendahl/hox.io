I have been focused on client development for so long it's strange to be
working on a medium in which I actually care about things like Search Engine
Optimization (SEO).

```typescript
import { amazingThings } from 'some-amazing-things'

/**
 * Tells everyone about the amazing things.
 *
 * @param things - An array of strings representing the amazing things.
 */
const tellEveryoneAboutTheAmazingThings = (things: string[]) => {
  for (const thing of things) {
    console.log(`THE ${thing} IS SO AMAZING!!! âœ¨ðŸ¥ºâœ¨`)
  }
}

tellEveryoneAboutTheAmazingThings(amazingThings)
```

As you can see I added a nice little code editor based on
[Monaco](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) by Microsoft the same
editor used in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The theme called
cobalt2 can be found [here](https://github.com/brijeshb42/monaco-themes).

I have plans for additional features for the blog but right now I'm just focused
on getting core functionality up.
