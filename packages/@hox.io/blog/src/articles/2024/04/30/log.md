Oh, Those cooky mathematicians!

"Inventing" or "discovering" (which can be debated) facts about the world
mathematics. For much of the history of mathematics learnings were made to fill
a need. Have a client that owes you a lot of money? Well, negative numbers might
be good for tracking that business relationship!

However, digressions about the world of business aside. I am here to tell a
story. It's a story about how mathematics became something more than a niche
hobby for aristocrats and became something AUTOMATED so that everyone is
allowed to be as ignorant as they please of how to define a limit or the right
situations to apply the arc tangent function. Now everyone is at all times
licensed to be as ignorant of the bytes running the simulation because now most
people carry a super computer in their pocket. üòÆ‚Äçüí®

üöÄ Let's hit the wayback machine!
Let's climb aboard the wayback machine. Setting the dial for way-way-back! Back
to a time before Vercel and Next.js, back to a time before React. Back to a time
when names were important and discoveries were not made my massive corporations
but individuals with way too much time on their hands.

Oh there's Mike Bostock writing his white paper on D3! There's Mr. Doob and
creating Three.js to bring demo scene to the web. But we're not going to linger
here we're going to the way back. We're going back through 2009. We just passed
Why the Lucky Stiff writing metaid to throw a wrench in the cogs of the Rails
community! Oh there's John Resig formulating a way to make browser quirks a
thing of the past.

There's Frank Deremer writing his 1969 PhD dissertation on the Look Ahead Left
to Right (LALR) parsing algorithm. A parsing algorithm that would be used in
almost every project until the early 2000s. There's Donald Knuth at Bell
Laboratories (author of The Art of Computer Programming) writing the original
research on LR parsing algorithmns. There's Noam Chomsky also at Bell Labs
formulating the Chomsky heirarchy of languages that would help to define formal
grammars as seperate and distinct from natural language.

ü¶ï We are passing into the digital paleolithic
Here are the US and Soviet Russia in a computing race. The Soviet's just
discovered the balanced ternary numbering system. An innovation that would have
opened the door to more efficient computers and chemical computing... Ah well
not every innovation gains footing. Here we are watching the first magnetic
tape reals put up on main frames that take up an entire building.

Now we aren't going all the way back. The webwork of connections that formulated
the origins of computer science goes as far back as the discovery (or invention)
of the natural numbers. We are going to pause at a period in the 1940s just
prior to the start of the WWII.

Keep in mind that back this far back computing exists only in the imagination.
The early writings on computing were understandably thought experiments. There
was no hardware realized to prove the veracity of this technical thinking.

Oh, those kooky mathematicians!

"Inventing" or "discovering" (oh, the eternal debate!) facts about the world
through mathematics. Throughout much of history, mathematical breakthroughs
emerged to fill specific needs. Have a client who owes you a stack of cash?
Enter negative numbers, the perfect tools for keeping tabs on such slippery
financial entanglements!

But let us sidestep business matters for now. I am here to weave a tale‚Äîa tale
of how mathematics morphed from a niche pastime of the aristocracy into
something AUTOMATED, freeing everyone to bask in blissful ignorance of defining
limits or when to deploy the arc tangent function. Today, thanks to these
advancements, every soul is perpetually licensed to remain unaware of the bytes
spinning the yarns of our digital existence, while toting around supercomputers
in their pockets. üòÆ‚Äçüí®

üöÄ All aboard the wayback machine! Fasten your seatbelts! We‚Äôre setting the dial
to the distant past‚Äîbeyond the age of Vercel and Next.js, even before React was
a twinkle in a developer's eye. Back when individuals, not colossal
corporations, were the name-makers and boundary-breakers in the wild world of
tech.

Ah, there‚Äôs Mike Bostock scribbling away his seminal D3 white paper! And over
there‚ÄîMr. Doob, conjuring Three.js to splash the demo scene across the web. But
hold tight, we‚Äôre not stopping here. We're traveling further back‚Äîzooming past
2009, waving at \_why the lucky stiff as he cheekily lobotomizes the Rails
community with his metaid mischief. There‚Äôs John Resig, wrestling browser quirks
into submission.

And behold‚ÄîFrank DeRemer in 1969, toiling over his PhD dissertation on the Look
Ahead Left to Right (LALR) parsing algorithm, a cornerstone in computing until
the early 2000s. There‚Äôs Donald Knuth at Bell Laboratories, penning the
foundational texts on LR parsing algorithms. And let's not forget Noam Chomsky,
also at Bell Labs, crafting the Chomsky hierarchy that would sharply delineate
formal grammars from the tangled webs of natural language.

ü¶ï Entering the digital paleolithic... Here are the US and Soviet Russia, locked
in a computational arms race. The Soviets stumble upon the balanced ternary
numbering system, a breakthrough poised to revolutionize computing‚Äîif only it
had caught on. Watch as the first magnetic tape reels spin to life on mainframes
that sprawl across whole rooms.

Yet, our journey doesn‚Äôt stretch to the very roots of computation. The intricate
web that spawned computer science stretches back to the discovery (or invention,
if you prefer) of natural numbers. We'll pause here, in the 1940s, just before
the world plunges into WWII.

Bear in mind, in these bygone days, computing lived solely in the realm of the
imagination, a series of thought experiments with no hardware to ground their
lofty speculations. Such were the whimsical origins of our now ubiquitous
digital landscape.

Oh, those nutty mathematicians!

"Inventing" or "discovering" (let's not split hairs over semantics) facts about
the world via the magic of mathematics. Throughout the annals of history, math
breakthroughs often sprang to life just to solve pesky human problems. Got a
client dodging the bill? Introducing negative numbers, your new best friend for
keeping track of financial freeloaders!

But let's shove business aside for a moment, shall we? I'm here to spin a yarn‚Äîa
quirky saga about how mathematics evolved from a hoity-toity hobby for the
well-heeled into something utterly AUTOMATED, liberating the masses to gleefully
ignore the mechanics of calculus and trigonometry. Now, anyone can afford to be
oblivious to the mathematical sorcery powering the devices in their pockets.
üòÆ‚Äçüí®

üöÄ Strap in for a jaunt in the wayback machine! Let‚Äôs crank this baby way, way
back‚Äîpast the trendy tech of Vercel and Next.js, way before React started to
react. We're talking about a time when discoveries were named by lone
eccentrics, not faceless corporate giants.

Look! There's Mike Bostock, doodling the first drafts of his D3 masterpiece!
Over there‚ÄîMr. Doob, spinning up Three.js to splash old-school demo scene
aesthetics across the burgeoning web. But hold your horses‚Äîwe're diving deeper.
We just blew past 2009, nodding at \_why the lucky stiff as he cheekily upends
the Rails community with his cunning code concoctions. And there‚Äôs John Resig,
bending browser quirks to his will.

Spotlight on Frank DeRemer in 1969, obsessing over his PhD thesis on the Look
Ahead Left to Right (LALR) parsing algorithm, a beacon of logic that guided
programming until the early 2000s. Not far, there‚Äôs Donald Knuth at Bell Labs,
hammering out the seminal research on LR parsing algorithms. And let's tip our
hats to Noam Chomsky, also huddled at Bell Labs, sketching the Chomsky hierarchy
that would crisply separate formal grammars from the murky waters of natural
language.

ü¶ï Now entering the digital Stone Age... Here we find the US and Soviet Russia
neck-and-neck in a computing showdown. The Soviets just tripped over the
balanced ternary numbering system‚Äîbrilliant, yet doomed to obscurity. Watch as
they load up the first magnetic tape reels onto mainframes the size of whales.

We‚Äôre not going all the way back to the cryptic origins of computer science,
which trace back to the dawn of natural numbers. We‚Äôll stop here in the 1940s,
right before the globe tumbles into WWII.

Remember, back then, computing was purely theoretical‚Äîa playground for
intellectuals with no actual hardware to test their wild theories. Ah, the good
ol‚Äô days, when digital dreams were just that‚Äîdreams!
