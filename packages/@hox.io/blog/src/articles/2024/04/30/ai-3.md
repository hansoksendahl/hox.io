Oh, those wacky mathematicians!

"Inventing" or "discovering" (pick your philosophical poison) tidbits about the
world via the arcane arts of mathematics. For eons, mathematical insights popped
up mainly to solve real-world pickles. Got a freeloader who‚Äôs forgotten their
wallet at home permanently? Thank goodness for negative numbers, the unsung
heroes of account balancing!

But enough with the capitalist interlude. Let‚Äôs dive into a story‚Äîa saga of how
mathematics evolved from an aristocratic diversion to a fully AUTOMATED beast,
empowering everyone to blissfully ignore the nitty-gritty of limits or the
arcane art of applying the arc tangent function. Now, the populace can luxuriate
in ignorance of the digital witchcraft powering the smartphones in their
pockets. üòÆ‚Äçüí®

üöÄ Time Traveling Shenanigans Buckle up, we're cranking the wayback machine to
full throttle! We‚Äôre shooting past the era of Vercel and Next.js, even before
React began rendering. Back to a golden age when names meant something, and
discoveries were the playground of eccentrics with too much time and not enough
Twitter followers.

There‚Äôs Mike Bostock, concocting his manifesto on D3! Over yonder, Mr. Doob
breathes life into Three.js, painting the web with a demo scene dazzle. But
don‚Äôt get cozy‚Äîwe‚Äôre not here to linger. We‚Äôre on a voyage through the annals of
2009, nodding to \_why the lucky stiff as he gleefully sabotages the Rails
establishment with his metaid antics. And there‚Äôs John Resig, engineering a new
era where browser quirks bow down to his code.

Fast rewind to 1969, and there‚Äôs Frank DeRemer hunched over his PhD, birthing
the LALR parsing algorithm‚Äîa mainstay in tech projects till the early 2000s. And
don‚Äôt miss Donald Knuth at Bell Labs, chiseling away at the foundations of LR
parsing algorithms. Ah, and the illustrious Noam Chomsky is also here, mapping
out his hierarchy of languages that would forever partition formal grammars from
the quagmire of natural speech.

ü¶ï The Digital Paleolithic Era Here are the US and Soviet Russia, locked in an
icy tango over computing supremacy. The Soviets just stumbled upon the balanced
ternary system, a brilliant spark that might‚Äôve fueled a revolution in computing
efficiency... alas, not every spark catches fire. Here we are, spectating the
first magnetic tape reels being mounted on mammoth mainframes.

But wait, our journey doesn‚Äôt rewind to the primordial soup of computing. No, we
halt in the 1940s, just before the world plunged into the chaos of WWII.

Remember, back in these ancient days, computing was nothing more than a
fantastical daydream‚Äîa series of thought experiments sans the silicon to make
them tangible.

üß† Minds Behind the Machine It all kicked off with Mr. Alan Turing and his
mentor, Alonzo Church. Turing, the sharp-eyed grad student, teamed up with
Church, who had already crafted a theory of computation with his lambda
calculus.

Turing, in a stroke of fate, envisioned how this theoretical framework could
play out in the real world through his alternative model, the "Turing Machine"‚Äîa
gadget armed with an infinite tape and four simple tricks: advance, rewind,
write, and read.

Church had already mapped out the first "Turing Complete" system in his studies
on lambda calculus. As Turing‚Äôs guide, they both snagged the trophy for
publishing a universal model of computation. Church pioneered the concept, and
Turing repackaged it for the masses.

üßë‚Äçüíª Parsing the Past During my undergrad days, I dove deep into parser theory,
particularly the GLR parsers capable of tackling natural languages in certain
scenarios. Unbeknownst to me, the seeds of machine learning were sprouting
nearby, soon to blossom into data science, then full-blown AI.

I spent hours lost in the mechanics of parsers, reveling in the challenge of
thinking like a machine to make any headway.

At Evergreen State College, I crafted an IDE in JavaScript using the then-new
Three.js to create interactive 3D visualizations‚Äîa leap from my earlier attempts
at a rudimentary 3D framework sans hardware acceleration. My first project aimed
to simplify the creation of 3D visuals with a language inspired by Ruby,
CoffeeScript, and NetLogo, designed to teach coding to kids, channeling \_why‚Äôs
philosophy.

But as the coding landscape evolved, so did the complexity of basic rendering
tasks, driving me to design an IDE that treated mathematical functions as
first-class citizens, cutting through the clutter.

Frustrated with relying on Jison for parsing, I embarked on crafting my own
parser generator, initially aiming for a GLR parser
