![A story about sobriety: I choose to

I don't talk about this as much as I should.

I acted as secretary to my first AA meeting this week a big step for me. I had
previously been through the whole AA program once but it didn't stick. I always
stayed away from service to others. I didn't want to be accountable to anybody
and I didn't want anybody to be accountable to me.

Life became very hard for me in 2020 and inch by inch I slipped back into
addiction taking it to a darker place than I had before. At the bottom of it I
didn't recognize myself anymore. I managed just barely to be sober for my son
but alone in my apartment racked by guilt, regret, and the demons of my past I
hit the bottle like I longed for the grave.

Like the namesake of my family, the musk ox (Oksendahl - "valley of the ox") I
have a thick skull. It seems sometimes realization only comes to me by banging
my head against the same obstacle over and over again. It takes many whacks
upside the head for me to correct my actions once I set down a path.

My almost daily intake was me self medicating pre-existing conditions. It was
born of a desire to silence the toxic narrative in my head, and a latent desire
for final silence and freedom from all of this. My intake of substances formed a
pattern of behavior with over 17 years of momentum behind it.

Life hit me hard enough to give me pause. My divorce in 2020 had happened during
the depth of the Covid crisis. As a result cross state travel was out of the
question for the divorce hearing. In the hearing my ex-wife was given a default
judgement awarding her full custody.

My ex and I had co-parented since the summer of 2021, when she moved to
Washington but I never had formal custody on paper. Well, last year in summer
2023 my sometimes unhinged behavior and communication triggered her to withhold
custody and file for a temporary family plan.

I had managed to be sober for the days my son was with me but without him in the
picture I was drowning in a sea of my own making. I got back in the AA program
but no one wanted to touch me as a sponsor. Every day was a new day one of
sobriety for a long time.

Watching my finances dwindle from the combination of bootstrapping a business,
the custody case , and my consumption I had to finally give in. I was licked, I
was not capable of making decisions that led to successful outcomes. I would
have to let go of my resentments, my attachments, and my biases to make any
forward progress. It seems the nullification of self I had been longing for was
not in the bottle but in a decision to let go of any sense that I had control.

I let go of my lawyer. I stopped fighting in the custody case. I started being
honest with myself, with people in the AA program, and with the people in my
custody case. I had to put my entrepreneurship efforts on hold and hope
desperately to find a job somewhere, anywhere to avoid bankruptcy.

After hundreds of job applications not hearing anything for almost six months. I
am happy to say I have four job interviews this week. I acted as secretary in my
first meeting on Monday. I am so happy to say that I know nothing except that my
relationship with my son is not something I am willing to lose.

I will not let my afflictions, addictions, or resentments control my life. I
don't know what the future holds but I know I have to let go to any notion that
I have control over any of it.

My will to power was a good survival mechanism until it wasn't anymore. When
things stopped going my way I burned my kingdom to the ground and everything
around me. I hope my story of the social and emotional desolation I eventually
found myself in is enough to warn others off of my path. I will continue to
carry my story to other addicts and alcoholics and hope I can save a few lives
in the process, both figuratively and literally.

I choose to live.
